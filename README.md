# BabelWiresAudio

This repository provides audio interface code for [BabelWires](https://github.com/Malcohol/BabelWires) applications, allowing them to record and playback audio.
It is not intended to be used independently.

I intend it to provide basic audio support for common desktop platforms. 
Right now, it just provides ALSA (Advanced Linux Sound Architecture) support.

It is currently used by [seq2tape](https://github.com/Malcohol/SeqWires/tree/main/Seq2tapeExe), allowing that program to load and save music sequencer data directly from cassette tape storage.
For platforms without BabelWiresAudio support, seq2tape can still load and save via audio files.
